# yii2-material
## Why this repository exist?

I bought a [MaterialUI Pro](http://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-pro) which depend on [bootstrap-material-design](https://github.com/jayHuang332/bootstrap-material-design). I found some display logic error when I used the widget of bootstrap with MaterialUI Pro. So I open this repository to manage the widget.

I won't put MaterialUI Pro assets on this repository because it's charged. Maybe you can use this repository with bootstrap-material-design.
